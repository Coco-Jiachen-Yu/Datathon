## Topic

Our group is interested in the impact of the COVID pandemic on the Job Market, with special attention to the LGBTQ population. We look at whether employment in cities with more LGBTQ populations is more greatly affected by Covid Cases. We also controlled the predictors that we found to be significantly correlated with employment to see if the effect from the LGBTQ population still persists. 

## Results

Here, we are making a general observation on how emplyment and COVID new cases change over the time in the United States.
